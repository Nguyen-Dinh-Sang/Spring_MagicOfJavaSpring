- POM: Project Object Model
- Maven Build Life Cycle:
    - Validate: validates the project.
    - Compile:
        - Compiling the source code.
        - Compiling the test code.

    - Test: where all the unit tests in your project are run.
        - If all the unit tests are successful, it would go to the package state.

    - Package: where it would actually build a jar.
    - Integration Test: If you have any integration tests.
    - Verify.
    - Install: basically taking your artifact which is generated and putting it to a local repository.
    - Deploy: where you take the generated artifact and deploy it to a remote maven repository.

    - nvm clean install: actually execute all the steps in the lifecycle up to install.

- How does Maven Work?
    - Local repository: on your system,
    - Remote Maven repository: kind of central repository, on the Internet, where all the versions of different dependencies
        are store.

- Important Maven Commands:
    - help:effective settings: you would see that all the settings which are used by the maven repositories.
    - help:effective pom: discussed earlier on maven prompt also have a parent form.
    - dependency:tree: show all the dependencies that are coming into your project.
    - dependency:sources: what would happen is all the source code for all the dependencies wherever it is available,
        would be downloaded to your local machine.
    - compile --debug: in debug mode, it would print you a lot more content than it would usually do.
